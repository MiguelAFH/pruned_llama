            The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about medicine.
            
            Question: A 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of left lower abdominal pain for 1 day. She describes the pain as 6 out of 10 in intensity. Over the past 5 months, she has had similar episodes of pain that occur once a month and last 1 to 2 days. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days. Menarche was at the age of 13 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She has been sexually active with 1 male partner in the past and has used condoms inconsistently. She tested negative for sexually transmitted infections on her last visit 6 months ago. Abdominal and pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's symptoms?
            A. CT scan of the pelvis
            B. Reassurance
            C. Combined oral contraceptive pill

            Question: A 47-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 10-day history of a sore throat and fever. He has a past medical history significant for ulcerative colitis and chronic lower back pain. He smokes at least 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years. The father of the patient died of colon cancer at the age of 50. He takes sulfasalazine and naproxen. The temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F), the blood pressure is 131/87 mm Hg, the pulse is 74/min, and the respiratory rate is 16/min. On physical examination, the patient appears tired and ill. His pharynx is erythematous with exudate along the tonsillar crypts. The strep test comes back positive. In addition to treating the bacterial infection, what else would you recommend for the patient at this time?
            A. Fecal occult blood testing
            B. Flexible sigmoidoscopy
            C. Low-dose CT
            D. Colonoscopy
            Answer: D
            
            Question: Blood cultures are sent to the laboratory. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is started. Transesophageal echocardiography shows a large, oscillating vegetation attached to the tricuspid valve. There are multiple small vegetations attached to tips of the tricuspid valve leaflets. There is moderate tricuspid regurgitation. The left side of the heart and the ejection fraction are normal. Which of the following is the most likely causal organism of this patient's conditions?
            A. Streptococcus sanguinis
            B. Enterococcus faecalis
            C. Neisseria gonorrhoeae
            D. Staphylococcus aureus
            Answer: D
            
            Question: A 45-year-old man comes to the physician because of a 3-month history of recurrent headaches. The headaches are of a dull, nonpulsating quality. The patient denies nausea, vomiting, photophobia, or phonophobia. Neurologic examination shows no abnormalities. The physician prescribes a drug that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2 by covalent acetylation. Which of the following medications was most likely prescribed by the physician?
            A. Indomethacin
            B. Aspirin
            C. Celecoxib
            D. Carbamazepine

            Question: A 58-year-old male with a history of congestive heart failure and hypertension comes to you with the chief complaint of new-onset cough as well as increased serum potassium in the setting of a new medication. Which of the following medications is most likely responsible for these findings?
            A. Furosemide
            B. Amiodarone
            C. Digoxin
            D. Lisinopril
            Answer: D
            
            Question: A 47-year-old man comes to the physician because of severe retrosternal chest pain and shortness of breath for 45 minutes. He has dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current medications include hydrochlorothiazide, lisinopril, metformin, and atorvastatin. He has smoked 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 20 years. He appears pale and diaphoretic. His temperature is 37°C (98.6°F), pulse is 115/min, and blood pressure is 140/70 mm Hg. Breath sounds are normal. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. An ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy with ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL, and V1–V6. High-dose aspirin, clopidogrel, metoprolol, sublingual nitroglycerin, and unfractionated heparin are administered. As the patient awaits transport to the nearest emergency room, he collapses and becomes unresponsive. His pulse and blood pressure cannot be detected. Despite resuscitative efforts, the patient dies. Which of the following is the most likely cause of death in this patient?
            A. Papillary muscle rupture
            B. Ventricular fibrillation
            C. Septal wall rupture
            D. Pulmonary embolism

She describes the pain as 6 out of 10 in intensity. Over the past 5 months, she has had similar episodes of pain that occur once a month and last 1 to 2 days. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days. Menarche was at the age of 13 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She has been sexually active with 1 male partner in the past and has used condoms inconsistently. She tested negative for sexually transmitted infections on her last visit 6 months ago. Abdominal and pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's symptoms?\nA. CT scan of the pelvis\nB. Reassurance\nC. Combined oral contraceptive pill\nD. Pelvic ultrasonography\nAnswer: B\n\nQuestion: A 47-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 10-day history of a sore throat and fever. He has a past medical history significant for ulcerative colitis and chronic lower back pain. He smokes at least 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years. The father of the patient died of colon cancer at the age of 50. He takes sulfasalazine and naproxen. The temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F), the blood pressure is 131/87 mm Hg, the pulse is 74/min, and the respiratory rate is 16/min. On physical examination, the patient appears tired and ill. His pharynx is erythematous with exudate along the tonsillar crypts. The strep test comes back positive. In addition to treating the bacterial infection, what else would you recommend for the patient at this time?\nA. Fecal occult blood testing\nB. Flexible sigmoidoscopy\nC. Low-dose CT\nD. Colonoscopy\nAnswer: D\n\nQuestion: Blood cultures are sent to the laboratory. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is started. Transesophageal echocardiography shows a large, oscillating vegetation attached to the tricuspid valve. There are multiple small vegetations attached to tips of the tricuspid valve leaflets.

            The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about medicine.
            
            Question: A 17-year-old girl comes to the physician because of left lower abdominal pain for 1 day. She describes the pain as 6 out of 10 in intensity. Over the past 5 months, she has had similar episodes of pain that occur once a month and last 1 to 2 days. Menses occur at regular 28-day intervals and last 5 to 6 days. Menarche was at the age of 13 years, and her last menstrual period was 2 weeks ago. She has been sexually active with 1 male partner in the past and has used condoms inconsistently. She tested negative for sexually transmitted infections on her last visit 6 months ago. Abdominal and pelvic examination shows no abnormalities. A urine pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's symptoms?
            A. CT scan of the pelvis
            B. Reassurance
            C. Combined oral contraceptive pill
            D. Pelvic ultrasonography
            Answer: B
            
            Question: A 47-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 10-day history of a sore throat and fever. He has a past medical history significant for ulcerative colitis and chronic lower back pain. He smokes at least 1 pack of cigarettes daily for 10 years. The father of the patient died of colon cancer at the age of 50. He takes sulfasalazine and naproxen. The temperature is 38.9°C (102.0°F), the blood pressure is 131/87 mm Hg, the pulse is 74/min, and the respiratory rate is 16/min. On physical examination, the patient appears tired and ill. His pharynx is erythematous with exudate along the tonsillar crypts. The strep test comes back positive. In addition to treating the bacterial infection, what else would you recommend for the patient at this time?
